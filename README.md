# S-rkinoid
Hello! I'm Lenni, a Finnish gane development student. This is here is the first game I've made and currently serves second  purpose as my portfolio. Hope to see you here again with some more interesting games!


Games I've worked on:

SÃ¤rkinoid:

A fishy take on arcade classic Arcanoid, made in Unity. The game was the first one I ever did completely alone from start to finnish and I wanted to try a lots things, including physics, score, enemies, collision, live systems, spawning pbjects etc. Below are some code snippets. 

The code used to check if players has hit the bricks (they also change colour when that happens!)

The code used to find where player is and for enemy to mowe towards them

ChangeHealth is used to take health from player or restore it. It also checks if they've ran out of health and gives game over
